                            <p dir="ltr">Dark Energy, a mysterious force that is the most abundant form of energy in the universe, yet it remains one of the biggest mysteries in science. The discovery of dark energy is often hailed as the most significant discovery in astronomy of the 21st century because of its impact on our understanding of the universe and its origin. Through this website, we’ll delve into the evidence that led scientists to propose the existence of dark energy, and the ongoing efforts to uncover the mystery of this elusive force.</p>

                            <p dir="ltr">Going back to 1926 we’ll visit Edwin Hubble and learn alongside him as he makes the groundbreaking discovery of an expanding universe. Then skipping forward to 1994 we can understand how Adam Riess expanded on Hubble’s discovery in the High Z project, which confirmed that the expansion of the universe was not only occurring, but was actually accelerating! So if you're ready to learn about one of the most intriguing mysteries in the cosmos, let's get started!</p>

This shift moves the spectral lines towards the red end of the absorption spectrum and was therefore proclaimed by Hubble as a "<strong><em>red shift</em></strong>." (Figure 2).</p>

The other <em><u>key point arising from the relation is that if we go back in time galaxies must have been closer together, and the universe was not as vast. If you extrapolate back far enough, the Universe must have been concentrated at a point in space, helping to confirm the Big Bang theory, which proposes that the universe began as a singularity and has been expanding ever since.</u></em> It also provided evidence that the universe is not static but is constantly changing and evolving.</p>

                    <p dir="ltr">However, each supernova had two different luminosities; absolute brightness and apparent brightness. Absolute brightness is the luminosity without extinction (or dimming) of its light due to absorption by interstellar matter and cosmic dust and apparent brightness is the luminosity observed from earth (peak brightness). Once the team was able to gather both brightness data samples for each of the 16 supernovae they used the Leavitt Law (Figure 5.), to find the luminosity distance, a measure of the distance to a celestial object, in our case the distance to each of the supernovae.</p>

                    <h2 dir="ltr">The Journey Doesn't End Here</h2>
                    <p dir="ltr ">The discovery of dark energy has been a long and fascinating journey that has taken us from the realization that the universe is contracting ever so slowly to the revelation that it is actually accelerating in its expansion. It all began with the work of Edwin Hubble, who observed that the universe was expanding and proposed the idea of an expanding universe. This idea was later confirmed by the work of Adam Riess, who discovered that the expansion of the universe was not only true but actually accelerating. Finally, we have come to understand that dark energy is the driving force behind this acceleration, and its presence can be indicated by a number, known as the “cosmological constant", or mathematically “lambda”. Despite the many mysteries that remain about dark energy, these discoveries have helped us to better understand the nature of our universe and the forces that shape it and I hope this website provides a useful resource for anyone interested in learning the limited information we have discovererd about this fascinating topic.</p>
